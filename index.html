<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>My name is Jennifer Kadowaki and I am a third year Ph.D. candidate in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Arizona. Under the supervision of my advisor, Dennis Zaritsky, I study the formation and evolution of massive, ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs)â€”a recently discovered population of spatially-extended, low surface brightness galaxies. By conducting an extensive search for UDGs in deep, large-scale imaging surveys with spectroscopic follow-up using the  Large Binocular Telescope, I will characterize the environments of this enigmatic population. Statistical characterization of their environments will enable me to test small- and large-scale evironmental mechanisms for star formation quenching in the most massive UDGs. </p>
